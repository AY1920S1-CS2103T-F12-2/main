== Introduction

*VISIT* is a *desktop address book application* for Doctors to *plan their visits* and *manage their patient information*. Most notably, VISIT is *optimized for Doctors who prefer to use a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having a pleasant Graphical User Interface (GUI). If your typing speed is sufficiently quick, VISIT can *greatly increase your efficiency* in managing your patient profiles and appointments. Interested in spending less time resolving logistical hiccups and more time doing your job? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
