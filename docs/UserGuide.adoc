== Introduction

*VISIT* is a *desktop address book application* for Doctors to *plan their visits* and *manage their patient information*. Most notably, VISIT is *optimized for Doctors who prefer to use a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having a pleasant Graphical User Interface (GUI). If your typing speed is sufficiently quick, VISIT can *greatly increase your efficiency* in managing your patient profiles and appointments. Interested in spending less time resolving logistical hiccups and more time doing your job? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `VISITapp.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for VISIT.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all patients
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a patient named `John Doe` to VISIT's address book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[TIP]
If no date is specified and the command is used without the prefix 'v/' (for example `addvisit 1`), the report will default to the current local date of the computer.
2. Key in the details in the respective fields of the pop-up form that appears.
+
image::UGAddVisit1.png[width="790"]
+
* Press kbd:[CTRL] + kbd:[Tab] to navigate to the next field (down)

image::UGEditVisit4.png[width="790"]

==== Deleting a visitation report : `deletevisit`

Deletes the specified visitation report. +
Format: `deletevisit INDEX [d/REPORT INDEX]`

[NOTE]
If no report index is specified, `deletevisit INDEX` will open a panel showing the reports of that patient and their relevant indexes of the reports. To delete the visit, simply re-enter the command with the desired report index.

=== *Appointment System*

====
VISIT also enables doctors to keep abreast and up-to-date on any events or deadlines as VISIT can be customized to remind them of any follow-up visits or other timed reminders.

There are two kinds of Appointments: Follow-Ups and Reminders.
====

==== Adding a follow-up visit with patient : `followup`

Adds a follow-up visit for a particular patient. The application will keep track of when your next appointment with the patient is on the Appointments window. +
Format: `followup INDEX [d/DAYS]`

[TIP]
The follow-up entry will by default generate the follow-up for 7 days' time if not specified.

*Examples*:

* `followup 9 d/10` +
Creates a follow-up entry on patient with index 9 for 10 days later.

==== Creating a generic reminder : `reminder`

Creates a new reminder to show up in the Appointments window. +
Format: `reminder TEXT [d/DAYS]`

[TIP]
The reminder entry will by default generate the prompt for 7 days' time if not specified.

*Examples*:

* `reminder Two Point Hospital closed d/7` +
Creates a reminder "Two Point Hospital closed" that will display for the next 7 days.

==== Removing an Appointment : `removeappt`

Remove an appointment from VISIT. This can be either a Follow-up or Reminder. +
Format: `removeappt DESCRIPTION [d/DAYS]`

[TIP]
Any appointment matching just the description will be removed if the specific days is not specified.

*Examples*:

* `removeappt Two Point Hospital closed d/7` +
Removes an appointment which description is "Two Point Hospital Closed" and had 7 days remaining.
* `removeappt Satya Nadella` +
Removes any appointments with the patient whose name is Satya Nadella.

==== Show Appointments "Message of the Day" box : `show`

Shows a pop-up containing the appointments. This is useful if you want to keep a small window just containing the appointments on the screen. +
Format: `show`

==== Sort Appointments : `sort`

Sorts the appointments in order of type, days remaining, and finally by name. +
Format: `sort`

=== *Optimization for Command-Line Interface (CLI) Users*

====
VISIT being an application optimized for doctors who are comfortable with CLI, has support for features such as aliasing for commands to enable command entries which are often used to be stored and used quickly and easily.
====

==== Setting a shorthand command / alias : `alias`

Set an alias for a command to enable faster command entry for a customized input. +
Format: `alias l/SHORTHAND v/COMMAND`

*Examples*:

* `alias l/ls v/list` +
Typing `ls` now works equivalently as typing `list`.
* `alias l/show all patients v/list` +
Typing `show all patients` now works equivalently as typing `list`.

==== Removing a shorthand command / alias : `unalias`

Delete an existing alias. +
Format: `unalias SHORTHAND`

*Examples*:

* `unalias ls` +
Typing `ls` will no longer be equivalent to typing `list`.

==== Showing all existing shorthand commands / aliases : `aliaslist`

Show all existing aliases. +
Format: `aliaslist`

Examples:

* `aliaslist` +
Shows all the existing aliases.

=== *Saving the data*

VISIT's address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== *Upcoming Features*
The following features are intended for a later release of VISIT that will further expand on the managing power doctors will be able to execute using the application.

==== Inventory System `[Coming in v2.0]`

VISIT v2.0 will include an inventory system for doctors to manage and organise their medical stores.
Doctors will be able to generate the list of medication in their stock and assign them to patients using the app
, which automatically deducts from that list. +
Warnings of low stocks are also an intended feature.

==== Printing of Medical Certificates `[Coming in v2.0]`

In v2.0, VISIT will allow doctors to easily print an official Medical Certificate with a single command.

==== Microsoft Azure Integration `[Coming in v2.0]`

Microsoft Azure is a popular Cloud Computing platform that allows for data analysis, remote deployment and user
authentication resources. We plan to leverage this power in VISIT v2.0 so that doctors may securely access
VISIT from any location, truly bringing VISIT on-the-go.
