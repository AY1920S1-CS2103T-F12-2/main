== PROJECT: VISIT

---

== Overview

VISIT is an open-source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software for *House Call Doctors*. It is based on a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application called AddressBook3 by the SE-EDU Initiative. The UnrealUnity Team comprising of 4 people including myself introduced features that allow these doctors on-the-go to manage their appointments in an easy and enhanced fashion. It is written in Java with its GUI created in JavaFX, and has about 16 kLoC.

I was tasked with conceptualizing and implementing the *Appointments* system comprising of *Reminders* and *Follow-ups*. This document highlights these features and provides the documentation for them from the User and Developer Guides.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the appointments system*
** What it does: Allows the user to create and manage appointments such as follow-ups with patients and general reminders.
** Justification: Doctors need a way to track when their next appointments are, or to follow-up with patients in their care, such as if the patient has been cured by the end of their antibiotics dose. They also need some way to track important deadlines and events through reminders, such as a particular hospital being closed.
** Highlights: This enhancement required two data structures to be used at the same time in parallel due to the underlying way data is stored in AddressBook3. Due to the lack of documentation from how most of the base project worked, a lot of tracing and trial-and-error had to be done.

* *Minor enhancement*: Forced commands without arguments to refuse execution if invalid arguments are still specified.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-06&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=ReignOfComputer&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-2%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[RepoSense]]

Stegotreon takes a PNG file and a line-separated text file, then automatically generates files with text hidden inside through steganograpy.

Artists on Patreon (and elsewhere) have an issue where their art is leaked outside the paywall. Some have resorted to sending image files directly to patrons, though leaks still happen. Stegotreon creates unique variants of the image file that can be reversed to identify the leaker, even if the file name is changed.

Stegotreon has the ability to send emails on your behalf using SMTP.

The Kerfuffle Cipher relays messages and data through matrices, represented as arrays in programming languages. Each character in a message will be represented by a 3x1 matrix.

Adding Java to Windows PATH is too many steps, this automatically tries to detect your Java installation and lets you choose to add it to your User Environment Variables (Machine with Administrator elevation). This allows you to use javac and java commands from CLI, such as Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell. Among other things.

Quick program for testing simple .java programs. Expects Java to be in System PATH, use JavaPather if not. Takes in a .java file, compiles (-cp) and runs it, optionally takes in input and output and compares.

Back in 2012, I was actively developing Windows Phone and Windows 8's Metro/Modern/Universal apps - which eventually led to a stint at Microsoft. SG Radio was one such app, and was developed and released as a launch app for Windows 8. SG Radio then went through a drastic upgrade in 2013 (for the release of Windows 8.1), and used as a showcase app in many of Microsoft's demos for both consumers and developers.

SG Radio aggregates various Singapore Radio stations, including Internet radio stations. It's able to get the title of the track that's currently playing and in the past, used Mediacorp's now defunct API to retrieve lyrics as well.

There are various other features built in, such as a standby mode that shows the current time and song, and a timer to shutdown playback after some time. Users are able to mark stations as a favorite, and can even bookmark a song that's currently playing.

Under RoC Apps, I have also made several applications for companies like Microsoft and Government of Singapore.
