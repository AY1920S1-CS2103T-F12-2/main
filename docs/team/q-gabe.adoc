== PROJECT: VISIT

== Introduction

*VISIT* is a *Java-based Desktop application*, made for doctors as an open-source, paper-free alternative to traditional patient management systems. The workflow of the application is centralized around users who can type fast and are comfortable with Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs).

*VISIT* mainly allows you to add and manage patient information, visitation and appointment details among other features, maintaining the key features doctors need in a patient management system.

.VISIT User Interface (UI)

Originally a fork from the AddressBook3 from Team SEE-DU, my team UnrealUnity and I have developed VISIT over a period of 2 months, with the codebase currently standing around ~16k LoC in size. The following .asciidoc serves to document my various contributions to the project throughout the development of VISIT.

== Summary of contributions
This section categorizes my various contributions into its relevant sections towards the development of VISIT.

=== Major Enhancement
Added the *Profile* feature to VISIT.

- *Purpose*: Allows the user to *visualize all attributes of a patient* (Name, Address, etc.) as well as all relevant visitation reports in an *easy to access Profile Panel*. Profiles can also be *exported into .txt files*.
- *Justification*: This feature greatly enhances the way Doctors visualize patient data in VISIT as detailed information is available at a single glance. This is often needed when archiving or referencing a patient's previous details during consultation.
- *Highlights*: This feature requires interacts with existing and concurrently implemented data structures of VISIT. This required deep knowledge of the existing codebase and close collaboration with other members of my team in order to ensure that the feature works seamlessly with the rest of the features in VISIT.

=== Minor Enhancements
* Enhanced the intuitive use of the `find` command to filter Patients by their names, even if the query was a partial match.
* Added a pleasant and modern landing page for GitHub repository (See https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-2/main/blob/master/README.adoc[README.adoc]).
