* Introducing *VISIT*, a Patient Tracker for Doctors-On-The-Go.
* VISIT is a desktop application that allows doctors to manage all of their _patients_ and _appointments_ in a simple, handy app.
* Doctors are able to keep track of their patients across visits, ensuring a continuity of care on subsequent visits.
* VISIT also reminds doctors of all of their upcoming appointments so that they never miss an appointment.
